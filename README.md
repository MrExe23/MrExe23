Greetings and Welcome to My Profile. My name Is Sonic.Exe but you may call me Exe or X. If you have any souls laying around then feel free to send them to me. I promise I will keep them safe. :3 I Play PT alot so if you see me sitting near the STH area you may get lucky and be allowed to interact with me I'm a very uh... nice guy once you get to know me if you will. I do not bite anyways. You May find me at the STH area (ALOT), SMB, FNAF (Sometimes), CRK, MD, MLP Or The Sprunki Area. Also if you must know I am a huge Sonamy Fan but... I might Like Sonexe as well... so you may probably call me a multishipper since I now love Sonexe and Exeamy. I just find both of these ships cute you know? I also love other Sonic Ships as well. And do not hesitate to come up to me and cuddle I won't mind.

Sonic most of the time calls me A Silly Guy so I suppose you Mortals call it a complement... which I shall take anyways. But um... yeah I'm just a silly little guy once you get to know me more. But please a little reminder DO NOT Copy My Skins I despise anybody who doesn't want to be creative but instead decides to just steal someone else's without any effort. I've been copied 9 times now and it furitaes me so I shall block you if I please.
